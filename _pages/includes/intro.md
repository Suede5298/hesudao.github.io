I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) <img src='./images/ust.png' style='width: 6em;'>. 
I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Shenghan ZHANG](https://www.ce.ust.hk/people/shenghan-zhang-zhangshenghan) since Sept. 2023. 

I received my Ph.D. in Automation Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://nuaa.edu.cn/) (NUAA)<img src='./images/nuaa.png' style='width: 6em;'>, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Fuyang CHEN. 
During 2023, I was also a Postdoctral Research Associate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)<img src='./images/polyu.png' style='width: 6em;'> and [National Rail Transit Electrification and Automation Engineering Technology Research Center (Hong Kong Branch)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cnerc-rail), working with Prof. [Yi-Qing NI](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/~yqni/). 
Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [NUAA](http://nuaa.edu.cn/). 

My research interest includes data-driven fault diagnosis and structural health monitoring with incomplete and unreliable data. I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3jbGRAYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*, *Reliability Engineering & System Safety* and *IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement*.
