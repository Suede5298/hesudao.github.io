I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) <img src='./images/ust.png' style='height: 1.5em;'>. 
I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Shenghan ZHANG](https://www.ce.ust.hk/people/shenghan-zhang-zhangshenghan) since Sept. 2023. 

I received my Ph.D. in Automation Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://nuaa.edu.cn/) (NUAA)<img src='./images/nuaa.png' style='height: 1.5em;'>, where I was fortunate to be involved in the Fault Dtection and Diagnostics Group led by Prof [Bin JIANG](http://nuaa.edu.cn/2023/1125/c485a325593/page.htm) (advised by Prof. [Fuyang CHEN](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/cfy/en/jsxx/32714/jsxx/jsxx.htm)). 
During 2023, I was also a Postdoctral Research Associate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)<img src='./images/polyu.png' style='height: 1.5em;'> and [National Rail Transit Electrification and Automation Engineering Technology Research Center (Hong Kong Branch)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cnerc-rail), working with Prof. [Yi-Qing NI](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/~yqni/). 
Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [NUAA](http://nuaa.edu.cn/). 

I have a broad research interest in leveraging AI for advanced structural sensing, inspection, and monitoring, with an ultimate goal to develop generalized digital twin paradigms that can leverage limited data resources to learn from mechanical and thermodynamic systems. My topics include visual measurement, multi-modal learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization, data stream mining, incremental learning, label-noise learning and federated learning.

I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3jbGRAYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsudao-he%2Fsudao-he.github.io%2Fgoogle-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data.json&query=%24.citedby&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*, *Reliability Engineering & System Safety* and *IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement*.
